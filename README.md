# community-smells
A repository to collect articles on community smells

# Concept

After finding a beautiful heatmap on Rude [Compounds on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/vmw0eu/oc_frequency_of_compound_insults_eg_poophead/), I wondered how this could be extended to a research topic. Github have some figures on [Sustainable communities](https://octoverse.github.com/#sustainable-communities), suggesting that *teams with high trust are more likely to have a healthy collaborative culture*:

> Developing is about community. Codes of conduct, contribution guidelines, Good First Issues, and respectful language in Discussions signal a community is safe, welcoming, and trusted. Communities with these signals attract more contributors, while also creating a stronger sense of belonging and fulfillment.

Wouldn't it be neat to quantize how programmers benefit from sustainable communites? There is some [related research](https://scholar.google.se/scholar?cites=17946175484241396803&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=sv) on the topic, regarding a phenomena called *community smells*. The research has potential to be interdisciplinary; depending angle of incidence I could collaborate with anthropologists and linguists. 

In this repository I am going to put summaries of papers and ideas that might lead to a scientific paper on the subject.

> We also found that there are civil alternatives to address arguments. 

A majority of non-technical emails include seemingly unnecessary "uncivil features". Are programmers rude by nature? 🤔
